# Restaurant Management System

This Python script implements a basic restaurant management system with the following features:

1. **Booking Tables**: Customers can book tables for either an early session (6pm - 8pm) or a late session (8pm - 10pm). They can place orders and leave tips if desired.

2. **Table Management**: The system tracks the status of tables (free or booked), along with associated costs. It identifies the table with the highest cost.

3. **Financial Tracking**: The system calculates total income and tips collected.

4. **Menu Popularity**: It displays the popularity of menu items based on the number of orders.

5. **Beverage Management**: Customers can add beverages to their booked tables during early or late sessions.

6. **Runtime Measurement**: The script measures the runtime of each operation selected by the user.
